# Evolutionary distinctiveness
## IMLS update, 2021-06-23, Andrew Hipp
As we have been waiting for our final sequencing results, which just came in at the end of May [Hooray!], I have been thinking about how to organize and use the phylogenetic data. I'll present today `edivColl` -- for Evolutionary Diversity in Collections -- which is the start of an `R` package that will provide tools for us and for others doing similar work.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(pdved)
```
