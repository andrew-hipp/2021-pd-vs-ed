# generate figure for IMLS document
First, get `edivColl` attached:


```{r setup}
  devtools::install_github('andrew-hipp/edivColl', dep = TRUE)
  # note that if you don't have dependencies already installed, set dep = TRUE or
  #   leave out the dep argument. it's in there now b/c updating dependencies is enforced
  #   and sometimes irritating during development.
  library(edivColl)
```
